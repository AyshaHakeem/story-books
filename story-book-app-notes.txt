Passport is an authentication middleware for Node that authenticates requests.
-pssport.initialize() initialises the authentication module.
-passport.session() is another middleware that alters the request object and change the 'user' value that is currently the session id (from the client cookie) into the true deserialized user object. | for passport.session() to work, you need express-session installed and required before passport middlewares
-The serializeUser() function sets an id as the cookie in the userâ€™s browser, and the deserializeUser() function uses the id to look up the user in the database and retrieve the user object with data.
